It's very very simple platformer game. In this game there is a character which runs and jump on fixed platforms to reach a target place, and while doing so if he gets in touch with fire placed in the way to target.
Then the character respawn and the game starts from the begining until he reaches the target position.
I made it for just learning purpose to make my hands oiled with python. You know it's just feel good when you see that you have created something.
